# js-datavisualisation-challenge
## What 
This is a JavaScript Challenge that take part of my formation at BeCode Brussels.   
The purpose of this challenge is to implement 3 graphics only using JS.  
For 2 of those graphics all the datas are in a given HTML.  
And for the third one the data are in a [link](https://canvasjs.com/services/data/datapoints.php) and the graph need to refresh with the newest datas every second.
## Who
This is a challenge that needs to be done alone, so it has been realized by Mathieu Herbos.
## When
We have from monday 27 of July 2020 to monday 10 August 2020 at 09.00am.
## How
I've split this challenge in different steps to get more organized : 
1. Create a repo on y profile and copy all the files needed from the repo of BXL-Swartz-3-21.
2. Check theorie first to get an idea of how to work with this challenge.
3. Recheck what was needed with the theorie in head.
4. Write step by step what is needed to realize this challenge.
5. Create the 2 first canavas:  
  5.1 Create via the DOM the canvas in the HTML.  
  5.2 Define what type of graph I want to draw.  
  5.3 Supply Chart.js with data, labels, and other options.  
6. Create the third canvas:
